# Getting Started with Vibesnap React App

## Setup Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
2. Copy the content of `env.txt` into a `.env` file located in the root directory of the project.
3. Ensure your Firebase project is properly configured:
   - Enable Google login under Firebase Authentication.
   - Enable Firestore Storage.
   - Enable Firestore Cloud Database.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

- Runs the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The page will reload automatically when you make changes.
- You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- See the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- Optimizes the app for the best performance and creates minified files.
- Filenames include hashes for efficient cache-busting.

Refer to the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for instructions.

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't revert the changes.

- Running this command copies all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project.
- Use this command only if you need full control over the build tools.
